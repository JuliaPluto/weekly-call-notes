# Weekly Pluto community call!

This is the weekly community call for Pluto! We discuss what happened in Pluto-land during the past week, what people are working on, and what we are planning for the future. 

The call is *open*, which means that everyone is welcome to join, also if you just want to listen. **Feel free to join!** (You do no need to work on Pluto's internal codebase to join! Most of us don't!)
