# New website is live!

[plutojl.org](plutojl.org)


- 
- docs: we could start with copying the wiki  https://plutojl.org/docs/
- Pluto github readme: maybe remove some "marketing", leave licences and technical stuff

- [https://featured.plutojl.org/](https://featured.plutojl.org/) with cool URLs like https://featured.plutojl.org/basic/getting%20started



Website ideas:
- Link directly to the julia .exe file with the right version and platform
  - Contribute this to the Julia website directly
  - Maybe just print the platform identified by the website so that noobs can still follow the official download page but know which platform to click on 
- Lots of docs with a full text search ([maybe helpful](https://juliacomputing.github.io/TinyStruggles/posts/stork-search-with-franklin/))
