## JuliaCon Eindhoven

No answer from organisers yet to locate the Pluto event on saturday 2th december. If no location is found, can we go to a coffee shop? or the Eindhoven library, Fons thinks that we can come with a big group and book a room on the spot.

Deadline to submit a talk proposal: 1st November 2023.

[https://juliacon.org/local/eindhoven2023/](https://juliacon.org/local/eindhoven2023/).

Fons can call the library to get information about booking. We can also have a Pluto booth during the conference on friday.

 - PyData Amsterdam in two days.
 - PyData Eindhoven
 - PyData global, 6th december anywhere on earth (virtual conference).
