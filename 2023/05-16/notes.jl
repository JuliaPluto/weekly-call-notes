# ipyflow

Stephen Macke presented ipyflow: reactive python jupyter kernel



much more complex than pluto, but probably easier for jupyter-brains



maybe the elixir/livebook model could be interesting here!

# Quarto

Talked with J.J. Allaire from posit about Pluto support for Quarto.



Very exciting!



# Visualizing cell dependencies

Colin Brown [https://cfp.jupytercon.com/2023/talk/ZATMJZ/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cfp.jupytercon.com/2023/talk/ZATMJZ/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1684249556229384&usg=AOvVaw34EfjulAvYQsMsN2B7gMuA) 



result was that observable minimap is great and they made it in jupyter



maybe we should also just do it! maybe its not bad to copy the design, since we are not copying their style or code?

# Accessibility

Jenn Kotler had a poster about accessibility in Jupyter (HTML exports)
