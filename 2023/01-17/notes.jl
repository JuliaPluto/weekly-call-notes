Topics
- Finishing Malt.jl
- Finishing PlutoDesktop



Ideas from Nehal:
- Certain cells have separate scope (cells in the side, on the right) (maybe as a scratchpad)
- Make it easier to create a notebook as package documentation (in terms of Pkg.activate and all that)

# Electron

Some pair programming to try to avoid webpack and react, its working!

Scope: 

IDEA!!

When you click File > New in the menu bar, it should go to the main menu screen, instead of going straight to an empty running notebook. This way you can still see the featured notebooks.

We really want one window per notebook! But for browsing the featured notebooks it might be tricky. Should be open featured notebooks in a new window?
